# Mother board :
***Definition***
- Is the mainframe of the computer through which all other components interface.
- Is the central circuit board making up a complex electronic system.
- Extends :
	- Basically, It's the central hub that connects all the components of the computer, from the processor and RAM to the hard drive and power supply.
	- There is a broad range of motherboards, each of which is intended to be compatible with a specific model and size of the computer.

***Structure***
- CPU sockets : 
- Memory slots :
- Bus slots
- SATA Connectors :
- Chip sets :
	- North Bridge Chip (replaced by CPU).
	- South Bridge Chip.
- Interfaces :
	- USB ports (Universal serial bus) : Many peripherals that utilize the USB interface such as mouse, keyboard, mice, printer,... It also supplies electrical power to the connected device. Its usually mounted in the I/O panel or some are located on the surface of the motherboard.
	- Build-in video adapter(integrated video adapter) : Older motherboards will have either DVI or VGA ports. Modern motherboards will have HDMI ports or Display ports. Integrated video adapters are good for normal everyday use with light application but are not very powerful for extensive graphic application such as gaming.  
	- Network interface card : enable computer to connect to the network and allowing us to browse to the web, send email and much more. It's responsible for receiving network signals and converting them to data that computer can understand. 
	- Build-in Sound card (integrated sound card) : processes audio through the computer speakers.

***Form Factor*** :
- Motherboard comes in different shapes and sizes and this is known as form factor.
- The most common form factor today is ATX(advanced technology extended) which was created in 1995. 
- Prior to the ATX was the AT form factor(Advanced technology) but it is no longer in development since success of ATX.
- Another well-known Form factor is Micro ATX, are smaller than ATX boards as its name suggests. It is a square design compared to the standard rectangle ATX and also have fewer features and consume less power than a standard ATX board.
- There are many other form such as Mini-ITX, Nano-ITX, Pico-ITX,....

# CPU :

***Definition*** :
- Is a machine that can execute computer programs.
- Is refered to as the brain of the computer.

- Extends :
	- Primary component that performs the arithmetic and logical operations necessary to run a computer.

***Function*** : performs 4 steps
>![[Pasted image 20240227220721.png]]

- Fetch : retrieving an instruction from program memory.
- Decode : break the instruction into parts that have signidicance to other portions of the CPU.
-  Execute : various portions of the CPU, such as the arithmetic logic unit(ALU) and the floating point unit (FPU) are connected so they can perform the desired operation.
- Writeback : write back the results of the execute step tp some form of memory.

# CPU interact with Motherboard:
- The CPU is installed into a specific socket on the motherboard, which varies depending on the processor type and motherboard design.
