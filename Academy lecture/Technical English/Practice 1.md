## Personal computing:
Name some types of computers you have learnt
?
5 -> Microcomputer, workstation, minicomputer, mainframe, supercomputer.
-        Microcomputer: an extremely fast computer that can perform millions of billions of instructions per second  .
-        Workstation: A powerful, single-user computer. A workstation is like a personal computer, but it has a more powerful microprocessor and, in general, a higher-quality monitor.
-        Minicomputer: A multi-user computer capable of supporting up to hundreds of users simultaneously.
-        Mainframe: A small, single-user computer capable of supporting many hundreds or thou

What is the difference between a mainframe and a PC?
?
+ Mainframe
-        Many people use at the same time
-        Largest, the most powerful, the most expensive
-        Process large amount of data
+ PC
-        The most common type of computer
-        Smaller, less powerful, cheaper than mainframe
