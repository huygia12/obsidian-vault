>[!todo]- Presenting "What is a computer ?"
>- Computers are electronic machines which can accept data in a certain form, process it and present in a specified format as information. Information in the form of data and programs is known as software, while the electronic and mechanical parts that make up a computer system are called hardware.
>- A standard computer system consists of three main sections: the CPU, the main memory and the peripherals. The CPU executes program instructions and coordinate the activites of all the other units, while the main memory holds the currently processed data by the CPU. The peripherals like storage devices provide a permanent storage of both data and programs or like input devices enable data to go into the computer’s memory and output devices enable the finished product to be extracted from the system. Computer also have many ports to connect all these kind of peripherals.
>- So all of these are the main physical units of a computer system also known as the configuration.
# Discussion :
##### 1. What is computer programming ?
- The process of designing and building an executable computer program for accomplishing a specific computing task.
##### 2. What is a programming language ? What is it used for ?
- Is a formal language, which comprises a set of instructions used to produce various kinds of output.

- Used in computer programming to create programs that implement specific algorithms.
##### 3. What common programming languages do you know ?
- Java, C#, C++, Python, Golang…
##### 4. Is programming language a formal or informal language? Is it easy or difficult learn ?
- must be a formal language in order to be executed by computer, to be read by human.

- low-level language like Assembly is difficult to learn but nowadays there are many high level languages that is much more understandable.
##### 5. What do you have to do if you want to learn programing languages ?
##### 6. How is programming language classified ?
- Based on evaluation history :
	+ Machine language
	+ Assembly
	+ High level language

- Based on interpretation:
	+ High level language
	+ Low level language
##### 7. What do you know about low-level programming language ?
- Has a close relation with computer hardware. Its instructions or commands are close to machine language.
##### 8. How is low-level programming language classiffied ?
- Into two languages:
	- Machine language/machine code
	- Assembly language
